## Interests

I play computer games since I am 7 years old. I started with Settler 5, Anno 1602 and Sim City 4. When I was 11 years old I discovered Minecraft on a friends birthday party through one of his friends and was really skeptical first but when I tried it I instantly fell in love with it. Shortly after that I got interested in Modding trough [direwolf20](https://www.youtube.com/user/direwolf20) and fell in love with mods like [Applied Energistics](https://ae-mod.info/), [Tinkers' Construct](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/tinkers-construct) or [Tech Reborn](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/techreborn) a remake of another mod I like namely [GregTech 4](https://forum.industrial-craft.net/thread/7156-gregtech-6-1-7-10-website-patreon-info-support-and-suggestions/).

Then in 2011 I discovered [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/) trough [Myratax](https://www.youtube.com/user/Myratax). It has everything I loved about Modded Minecraft and was heavily inspired by it. Soon I started patching broken mods, updated them to the newest version and [wrote some on my own](https://mods.factorio.com/user/supersandro2000) which got several thousand downloads.

The following years I did several main and side projects including an [Android app](#emoticons-sticker-pack-for-whatsapp), contributions to a lot of open source projects, self hosting several services including Nextcloud, Mastodon, Matrix and much more. I started writing [Docker Images](#docker-images) which I collect in a public [repository](https://github.com/SuperSandro2000/docker-images/) for everyone to use and improved a lot of Dockerfiles in open source projects. I am collecting Steam games, run a public [1:1 same set Steam card trade bot](https://steamcommunity.com/id/SuperSandro2000/) and archived all Factorio downloads, mods, website and the wiki. I planed to do the same for HumbeBundle Trove and Twitch Games in the future. If you are on the search for a download please reach out to me and I may be able to help you.

I love working with Docker, Linux and open source software. I occasionaly read InfoSec posts, try to stay privacy focused and adapted the website from [this github project](https://github.com/github/personal-website/).

## Maintained projects

### [ddclient](https://github-com/ddclient/ddclient)

DDClient is a perl script which updates DynDNS services's with an IP addresses sourced from routes, websites or ifconfig/ip. Currently we are pushing to get 4.0.0 ready with full IPv6 support, test suite and a cleanup of the codebase.

### [factorio-docker](https://github.com/factoriotools/factorio-docker)

I am one of the maintainers of the factorio server docker image. I wrote most parts of the CI scripts, keep the images updated and occasionaly fix bugs.

### [ModOrganizer 2](https://github.com/modorganizer2/modorganizer)

I worked on the [build system](https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer-umbrella) for ModOrganizer 2 that is written in Python.


## Personal Projects

### [Cheat-sheet](https://github.com/SuperSandro2000/cheat-sheet)

I maintain a cheat-sheet where I try to collect one-liners and other usefull script snippets.

### [Docker images](https://github.com/SuperSandro2000/docker-images)

All docker images I wrote live in that mono repo and get daily builds and pushes to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/supersandro2000).

I try to make every image multiarch (amd64, arm32v7, arm64v8) where native arm binaries are available or easily coss-compilable (eg Go) or the project is based on a scripting language.

### [Emoticons Sticker Pack for WhatsApp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.supersandro.stickers.emoticons)

A small app that adds 140+ stickers to WhatsApp.

### [Factorio mods](https://mods.factorio.com/user/supersandro2000)

I have written severall mods for my all time favorite factory-building and management game [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/).

My oldest mod is from well before the mod portal and only lives on the [forums](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=44&t=4343). You can get the source from [GitHub](https://github.com/SuperSandro2000/AlienPlant).

### [Factorio mod archiver](https://github.com/SuperSandro2000/factorio-mod-archiver)

The first data archiving script I wrote. It collects all factorio mods, downloads them with a hash file and optionally uploads it all to Google Drive.

### [Factorio mods bot](https://github.com/SuperSandro2000/factorio_mods_bot)

A small Telegram bot that sends messages to a Telegram channel whenever a new mod gets released or an existing one updated.
