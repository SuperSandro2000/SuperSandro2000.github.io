## Interests

I play computer games since I am 7 years old. I started with Settler 5, Anno 1602 and Sim City 4. When I was 11 years old I discovered Minecraft on a friends birthday party through one of his friends and was really skeptical first but when I tried it I instantly fell in love with it. Shortly after that I got interested in Modding trough [direwolf20](https://www.youtube.com/user/direwolf20) and fell in love with mods like [Applied Energistics](https://ae-mod.info/), [Tinkers' Construct](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/tinkers-construct) or [Tech Reborn](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/techreborn) a remake of another mod I like namely [GregTech 4](https://forum.industrial-craft.net/thread/7156-gregtech-6-1-7-10-website-patreon-info-support-and-suggestions/).

Then in 2011 I discovered [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/) trough [Myratax](https://www.youtube.com/user/Myratax). It has everything I loved about Modded Minecraft and was heavily inspired by it.

The following years I did several side projects including an [Android app](#emoticons-sticker-pack-for-whatsapp), contributions to several open source projects, the creation of several [Telegram notifications channel](#telegram) and a few [Docker Images](#docker-images). I started collecting [Steam games](#steam) and run a public 1:1 trade bot. In 2018 I started publishing mods for Factorio.

Later that year I started to archive all game downloads and mods, the website and wiki. I have plans to do the same for HumbeBundle Trove downloads in the future.

## Personal Projects

#### [Canuby](https://github.com/SuperSandro2000/canuby)

Canuby is my attempt to write a modular and very flexible dependency manager that can download, build and stage multiple languages.

#### [Cheat-sheet](https://github.com/SuperSandro2000/cheat-sheet)

I maintain a cheat-sheet where I try to collect one-liners and other usefull script snippets.

#### [Docker images](https://github.com/SuperSandro2000/docker-images)

All docker images I wrote live in that mono repo and get daily builds and pushes to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/supersandro2000).

I try to make every image multiarch (amd64, arm32v7, arm64v8) where native arm binaries are available or easily coss-compilable (eg Go) or the project is based on a scripting language.

#### [Emoticons Sticker Pack for WhatsApp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.supersandro.stickers.emoticons)

A small app that adds 140+ stickers to WhatsApp.

#### [Factorio mods](https://mods.factorio.com/user/supersandro2000)

I have written severall mods for my all time favorite factory-building and management game [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/).

My oldest mod is from well before the mod portal and only lives on the [forums](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=44&t=4343). You can get the source from [GitHub](https://github.com/SuperSandro2000/AlienPlant).

#### [Factorio mod archiver](https://github.com/SuperSandro2000/factorio-mod-archiver)

The first data archiving script I wrote. It collects all factorio mods, downloads them with a hash file and optionally uploads it all to Google Drive.

#### [Factorio mods bot](https://github.com/SuperSandro2000/factorio_mods_bot)

A small Telegram bot that sends messages to a Telegram channel whenever a new mod gets released or an existing one updated.

### Projects I contributed to

#### [factorio-docker](https://github.com/factoriotools/factorio-docker)

I am one of the maintainers of the factorio server docker image. My main task is it to keep the build system up and running.

#### [ModOrganizer 2](https://github.com/modorganizer2/modorganizer)

I worked on the [build system](https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer-umbrella) for ModOrganizer 2 that is written in python.

### Telegram

I maintain several Telegram channels:

Renovate Nightlies Update Channel (Custom ROM disconinued): [t.me/RenovateNightlies](https://t.me/RenovateNightlies)
